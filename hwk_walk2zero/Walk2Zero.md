## 🏗 What are you building?
Walk2Zero : Taking Climate Conscious Steps

## 🛠 What does it do?
A tool/service that calculates how much carbon a user can 
potentially offset if they opt for walking or use public 
transport to get to  their point of destination. 

## 📍 What are key features of your system?

- Basic user end that takes into consideration Location, 
  Destination, Mode of transport
  
- Takes user end input and get distance from Google Maps API,
  returns emission comparison for vehicle, public transport and walking
  
- Log in feature, and save user journey into Database

- Track total carbon offset for each user and represent 
  it as e.g. number of trees

## 👷 Team's approach to the project work
### Workload Distribution
Before we distribute workload, we will break down user stories to manageable tasks/tickets on Github kanban board, 
and estimate story points to each ticket, prioritising our backlog according to its importance as well as its size(story points). 

We will then distribute workload based on the team member's interest and make sure each of us has
similar size of tickets. If a ticket size is large, we will assign two people on the ticket, or more if necessary.
We will also make sure the rest teammates review the code before the pull request being merged.

Because things are new to the team, and we are still learning, the roles will be interchangeable this time.
